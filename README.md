PHPVideoToolkit V2...
==================

...is a set of PHP classes aimed to provide a modular, object oriented and accessible interface for interacting with videos and audio through FFmpeg.

It also currently provides FFmpeg-PHP emulation in pure PHP so you wouldn't need to compile and install the module. As FFmpeg-PHP has not been updated since 2007 using FFmpeg-PHP with a new version of FFmpeg can often break the module. Using PHPVideoToolkits' emulation of FFmpeg-PHP's functionality allows you to upgrade FFmpeg without worrying about breaking existing funcitonality.
